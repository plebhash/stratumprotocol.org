# Getting Started with running SRI - Stratum V2 reference implementation

This document aims to assist users in deploying the SRI software stack efficiently. Stratum v2 as a protocol is flexible, and allows users to run multiple different configurations.

There are 4 possible configurations for SV2 deployments:
- **Config A**: SV2 firmware with Job Declaration Protocol
- **Config B**: SV2 firmware without Job Declaration Protocol
- **Config C**: SV1 firmware without Job Declaration Protocol
- **Config D**: SV1 firmware with Job Declaration Protocol

The Job Declaration Protocol allows miners to construct their own block templates.

We are going to focus on Configs C and D, because most of the mining industry today still uses SV1 firmware.

The SRI team is hosting a Pool, Template Provider (TP) and Job Declarator Server (JDS) to aid testing on the miner side.

Alternatively, you can also deploy your own Pool, TP and JDS to get the full infrastructure experience.

## Prerequisites

### Install Rust

You'll needRust installed on your machine. If it's not:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Clone SRI repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum
```

### Run Template Provider

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is only necessary if you're going to be running either:
- Local Config C
- Hosted Config D
- Local Config D

You can skip this step if you're running Hosted Config C.

Download a release from Sjors' fork of Bitcoin Core from https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/releases

Edit your `bitcoin.conf` file by adding:
```bash
[testnet]
server=1
rpcuser=username
rpcpassword=password
```

Start the Template Provider:

```bash
./bitcoin-sv2-tp-0.1.2/bin/bitcoind -testnet -sv2 -sv2port=8442 -debug=sv2
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: you need to wait until `bitcoind` is fully synced with the testnet before you proceed. You can watch [mempool.space/testnet](https://mempool.space/testnet) and compare the current testnet block height with your logs.

Optional paremeters:

There are optional parameters which can be used to better manage the Template Provider:
- `sv2interval` - sets how often a new template is built (default is 30s)
- `sv2feedelta` - defines the delta fees to reach before sending new templates to downstreams (default is 1000 sats)
- `loglevel=sv2:trace` to get more detailed debugging

For example: 

```bash
./bitcoin-sv2-tp-0.1.2/bin/bitcoind -testnet -sv2 -sv2port=8442 -sv2interval=20 -sv2feedelta=1000 -debug=sv2 -loglevel=sv2:trace
```
This way new templates are constructed every 20 seconds (taking the most profitable txs from the mempool) and they are sent downstream if new fees collected are more than 1000 sats.

You're ready to start mining. Skip to the [Connect Mining Devices](#connect-mining-devices) step.

---

## Connect Mining Devices

Connect mining device - Translator Proxy will be running on port `34255`, so you will need just to edit your mining device(s) configuration, adding the line:

`stratum+tcp://<tProxy ip>:34255`

If you don't have an ASIC, skip to the [CPU miner step](#cpu-miner) below.

---

## CPU Miner
If you don't have a physical miner, you can do tests with CPU Miner.

Setup the correct CPUMiner for your OS:
- You can download the binary directly from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cpuminer/files/);
- Or compile it from [https://github.com/pooler/cpuminer](https://github.com/pooler/cpuminer)

On the CPUMiner directory:
 
```
./minerd -a sha256d -o stratum+tcp://localhost:34255 -q -D -P
```

## Adjust `tproxy-config` (optional)

Depending on mining device you do run, you may have to adjust `tproxy-config*.toml` file in order to adjust the `min_individual_miner_hashrate` and `channel_nominal_hashrate` parameters to have an optimal difficulty target for the channel.


## Monitoring for blocks

Once set up, monitor the machines and role logs for any valid blocks found.

Following pictures detail the logs from tProxy, JDC, and Pool when a block is found.

Pool logs

![SRI Pool](/assets/SV2Pool-logs.png)

Job Declarator Client (JDC) logs

![SRI JDC](/assets/JobDeclaratorClient-JDC-logs.png)

Translation Proxy tProxy logs

![SRI tProxy](/assets/TranslationProxy-tProxy-logs.png)

If you didn‚Äôt change anything in the configuration files present in every role subdirectory, the valid block mined will be recognized by the string `Stratum V2 SRI Pool (0x5374726174756d2076322053524920506f6f6c)` inserted into the scriptSig of the coinbase tx input. 

A way to look for it is to check the address `tb1qa0sm0hxzj0x25rh8gw5xlzwlsfvvyz8u96w3p8` since the default coinbase output is configured to be a P2WPKH built with a public key = `036adc3bdf21e6f9a0f0fb0066bf517e5b7909ed1563d6958a10993849a7554075`

You can perform a search on one of the following block explorers:
- [mempool.space/testnet](https://mempool.space/testnet)
- [blockstream.info/testnet](https://blockstream.info/testnet/)

## Customizing configuration

### Customize the `pool_signature` string
To customize the string which is inserted into the `scriptSig` of the coinbase tx input, you need to run every role locally. To make changes, edit the `pool_signature` field present the config files:

- **Hosted Config C**: no changes needed, the hosted pool is imposing the `pool_signature`
- **Local Config C**: `roles/pool/config-examples/pool-config-local-tp-example.toml`
- **Hosted Config D**: `roles/jd-client/config-examples/jdc-config-hosted-example.toml`
- **Local Config D**: `roles/jd-server/config-examples/jds-config-local-example.toml` + `roles/jd-client/config-examples/jdc-config-local-example.toml` (make sure that the strings are equal on both files, otherwise templates will be rejected by JDS)

### Customize the `coinbase_output` script
To customize the coinbase tx output script, you need to run every role locally. To make changes, edit the `coinbase_output` field in the config files:

- **Hosted Config C**: no changes needed, the hosted pool is imposing the `coinbase_output`
- **Local Config C**: no changes needed, the hosted pool is imposing the `coinbase_output`
- **Hosted Config D**: `roles/jd-client/config-examples/jdc-config-hosted-example.toml`
- **Local Config D**: `roles/jd-client/config-examples/jdc-config-local-example.toml` + `roles/jd-server/config-examples/jds-config-local-example.toml` (make sure that the `coinbase_output` field is identical on both files, otherwise templates will be rejected by JDS)

You can use any of the following script types:  P2PK,P2PKH, P2WPKH, P2SH, P2WSH, P2TR. 
In case a public key is required, as explained in the config files, you can start by creating a testnet wallet on mobile, using Green wallet, or a desktop one, using Electrum wallet, and extract the extended public key they provide. At this point, you can derive the child public key to use in the configuration files, [using this tool](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/tree/dev/utils/bip32-key-derivation).
